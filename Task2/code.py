print('\n=== Key Patterns and Trends Suggestion ===')
print('- Survival rates are notably higher among women and first-class passengers.')
print('- Most passengers are aged 20–40; outliers exist for age and fare.')
print('- High positive correlation: SibSp (siblings/spouse) and Parch (parents/children), indicating families travel together.')
print('- Strong negative correlation: Pclass and Fare—higher class means higher fare.')
print('- Outliers: There are extreme values for Fare (e.g., 512), likely wealthy passengers.')

# 5. Feature-level Inferences from Visuals (examples for your report)
print('\n=== Basic Feature-level Inferences ===')
print('- Age: Median passenger age is about 28. Many children (Age <12) traveled in 3rd class.')
print('- Fare: Fares skew right; most paid under 50, but with some very large outliers in 1st class.')
print('- Pclass vs Survival: 1st class passengers had far greater survival odds than 3rd.')
print('- Family features SibSp and Parch: Large families less common among survivors; singles/duos fared best.')
print('- Visuals highlight clear class and gender disparities in survival (which is well-established in Titanic EDA).')
